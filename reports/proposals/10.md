## Simple Summary

Proposal to release a grand total of 16’000 USDC, for periodic Aave <> Immunefi bounty payouts and Immunefi fee.

## Motivation

As disclosed in [this post](https://governance.aave.com/t/bgd-aave-immunefi-request-for-bounty-payouts/15751), we think it is appropriate to split bug bounty payouts from disclosure and fix stages, for Low, Medium and High reports.
The objectives are not creating unnecessary interdependencies, and keep a healthy and frequent payment schedule for white-hats participating securing Aave.

## Specification

This proposal, will release the following funds to white-hat addresses and the Immunefi platform, from the Aave Ethereum Collector:

- $5’000 to `0x8689e84af34A18Bc461928aa554a71C649beED89`.

- $10’000 to `0xD122c282499Cb6A76197db2D6ba5170D81C4895f`.

- $1'000 to `0x2BC5fFc5De1a83a9e4cDDfA138bAEd516D70414b` (immunefi.eth). This is the fee corresponding to the 10% of the previous bounty only, as the extra $500 for the first one have already been paid in the round of December 2023.

After checking with a financial contributor to the DAO (TokenLogic & Karpatkey), _the asset used for the transfers is aUSDC v2 Ethereum_.
